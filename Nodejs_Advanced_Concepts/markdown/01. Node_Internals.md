```javascript
app.js // JavaScript Code We Write
 
node app.js // On Command line

V8   // Open-Source JS Engine created by google, Browser가 아닌 Terminal 등과 같은 곳에서 JS 코드를 실행시켜줌.                    

libuv // c++ Open-Source Project, Nodejs가 OS, Network, Concurrency 등에 접근하고 다룰 수 있게 해준다. 
```

# What is the purpose of Node JS?

왜 **V8** or **libuv**를 바로 사용하지않고 **Node**를 전적으로 사용하고 있을까?

1. **V8 Engine**과 **libuv** 둘 다 C++ 사용의 빈도가 JS 사용의 빈도보다 높다. JS를 사용해 동작하고 싶은 목적이 첫번째 이유다. (비록 실제로 C++로 동작 될지라도).

2. **http, fs, crypto, path** 등과 같은 **module**을 사용시 **C++** 대신에 **JS**를 이용해 사용할 수고, **libuv** 없이 **Node** 환경이 위와 같은 **modules**를 지원하기 때문이다.

# The Basics of Threads

![image-20200221212820939](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\10.Node)

Thread란?

컴퓨터 프로그램을 실행시킬때 process 라는 것이 실행된다. process 는 running program or 컴퓨터 프로그램의 인스턴스(instance)이다. 그리고 single process 내에는 multiple things를 가질 수 있는데 이것을 "thread"라 칭한다. 위 사진의 Thread 밑의 글을 보면, 마치 TodoList 처럼 생긴 것을 확인할 수 있다. 각 List를 instruction이라 칭하고 각 instruction이 수행하기위해 컴퓨터의 CPU를  필요로한다. 위 Thread는 CPU에게 주어지고, CPU는 각 instruction을 one by one starting at the top and then going down 방향으로 수행한다. 그렇다면, single process 내에는 multiple things를 가질 수 있다고 했으니 아래 사진과 같이 Thread를 두 개를 가지는 것도 가능할까? 가능하다. 그리고 그 이상 가지는 것도 가능하다.

![image-20200221213536405](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\11.Node)

더 자세히 확인하고 싶으면 작업 관리자 탭에서 CPU 사용도를 확인하면된다.

![image-20200221213921543](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\12.Node)

현재 나의 컴퓨터에는 259개의 processes와 3529개의 Threads가 동작하고있음을 알 수 있다. Thread를 이해하는데 가장 중요한 점은 Scheduling이다. Scheduling은 OS의 능력인데 어느 시점에 어떤 Thread에게 어떤 instruction을 할당하는가이다. 논리적으로, 한 대상에게 동시에 발생하는 동작에서 Scheduling이 없다면 두 동작이 정상적으로 반영되었음이 보장되지않기 때문이다.

![image-20200221224018053](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\13.Node)

기억해야할 점은 각 Computer에는 Limited Amount of Resources and the computer's CPU only can process so many instructions per second. 위 사진과 같이 many active processes and threads가 존재한다. 이 중에 몇몇 Thread는 urgent responsibility가 부여된 Thread가 존재한다.

예시: mouse가 움직이면 그 instruction을 담당하는 Thread 등등

OS Scheduler가 각기 다른 Threads를 확인하고 적절한 amount of work가 process되게하거나 혹은 processing 과정이 너무 길지 않게 control해주는 역할을한다. Urgent Responsibility를 가진 Thread의 Instruction이 발생했을때 이 Thread를 너무 오래 기다리지 않게 하는 것이 중요하다.

마우스 커서를 움직였을때 5초 후에 할당한 Instruction이 동작하면 User는 컴퓨터가 고장났다고 생각할 것이다. 

![image-20200222104852379](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\14.Node)

If we have more than one core inside of our CPU then we can easily process multiple threads at the same time. One thing I want to mention here is that technically one core can process more than one threaded time through a process called multip-threading or you may have also heard it referred to as hyper-threading as well. But right now let's say that one more cores means more threads processed at once. 

The second thing we can do is more closely examine the work that is being done by each thread. Let's imagine for a second that we have two threads here that are both competing for processing power thread.

The thing to keep in mind is that any time our computer tries to read data off of some type of medium like a hard drive, we refer to that as input or output operations and it always take some non-zero amount of time. During this IO phase right here your CPU is waiting on the hard drive to read some file and return its content.

And during that time this thread number one has absolutely nothing else to do. It's just sitting there waiting for the hard drive to get some information. Your OS Scheduler has the ability to detect this downtime or this kind of pause between instructions and it can decide to put thread number one on pause and then execute Thread number two and then as soon as thread number two is complete it can go back over thread number one and continue waiting on the harddrive to be read from the person to the file to be read from the hard-drive.

![image-20200222104955438](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\15.Node)

I/O Operation은 무조건 일정 시간이 필요하기때문에. CPU가 Hard-Drive에서 File을 찾고 Return 해주기 까지에 시간이 걸리기 때문에 이 찾아오는 과정에 Thread #1은 놀고있게된다. OS Scheduler는 Thread #1 놀고있는 것을 알 수 있는 능력이있고, 이때 남는 시간에 Thread #2의 1번 Instruction을 동작을 완료시키고 다시 Thread #1으로 돌아와 나머지 Instruction을 완수한다.

You OS Scheduler has the ability to detect this downtime or this kind of pause between instructions and it can decide to put thread number on on pause and then execute. Thread number two and then as soon as thread number two is complete it can go back over to thread number one and continue waiting on the harddrive to be read from the person to the file to be read from the hard drive.

Threads are units of instructions that are waiting to be executed by the CPU deciding which order to execute these threads in is referred to as scheduling. Scheduling is controlled by your OS to ways of improving the rate at which we process threads either add more CPU Core to our machine or to allow our OS Scheduler to detect big pauses in processing time due to expensive input and output operations.

# Question

Multithread good ? or not?

I've read somewhere that having many CPU sometimes might not be a really good thing. Coz for example, if 2 of them are trying to access the same memory location it might cause problems, so thought should shart it.

**Answer**

Having multiple threads can lead to issues around access. Node circumvents(우회하다) these issues by only allowing one thread to access variables at a time.

# The Event Loop Implementation

```javascript
const pendingTimers = [];
const pendingOSTasks = [];
const pendingOperations = [];

// New timers, tasks, operations are recorded from myFile running
myFile.runContents();

function shouldContinue() {
    // Check one: Any pending setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate?
    // Check two: Any pending OS tasks? (Like server listening to port)
    // Check three: Any pending long running operations? (Like fs module)
    return pendingTimers.length || pendingOSTasks.length || pendingOperations.length
}

// Entire body executes in one "tick"
while(shouldContinue()) {
    // 1) Node looks at pendingTimers and see if any functions
    // are ready to be called. setTimeout, setInterval
    
    // 2) Node looks at pendingOSTasks and pendingOperations
    // and calls relevant callbacks
    
    // 3) Pause execution. Continue when...
    // - a new pendingOSTask is done
    // - a new pendingOperation is done
    // - a time is about to complete
    
    // 4) Look at pendingTimers, Call any setImmediate
    
    // 5) Handle any 'close' events
    
}

// exit back to terminal
```

Close Event Example

```javascript
readStream.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Cleanup Code')
})
```

# Is Node Single Threaded?

![image-20200223032135249](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\16.Node)

 Technically, Node Event Loop uses a single thread, but a lot of code that I write does not execute inside that thread entirely.

```javascript
//threads.js
const crypto = require("crypto");

const start = Date.now();

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("1:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("2:", Date.now() - start);
});

// Results
1: 746
2: 752
```

The libuv Thread Pool을 보면

실제로 hasing process가 발생하는 곳은 Node's C++ Side이다. 위에서 언급했듯이 libuv library는 Node가 OS와 같은 기반 시스템에 더 잘 접근할 수 있게해준다.

또한 libuv module은 another responsibility를 가지고있다. This responsibility는 standard library의 몇몇의 특점 함수와 관련이있다. libuv module은 event loop를 이용한 expensive calculation대신, a thread pool that thread pool is a series of four thread that can be used for running computationally intensive tasks such as the pdkdf. By default, libuv creates four threads in this thread pool. So that means that in addition to that thread used for event loop, there are four other threads that can be used to offload expensive calculations that need to occur inside our application. Many of the functions included in the node standard library will automatically make use of this thread pool. And as you might imaging that the pbkdf2 function is one of them.

Now the presence of this thread pool is very significant. Obviously from the standpoint of people always saying oh yeah node is a single threaded. Well clearly it's not truly single threaded becase there are other threads that node uses for doing some computationally intensive tasks. You see this thread pool here because if our event loop was responsible for doing this computationally intensive task that means that our node application could do absoultely nothing else we were running the pbkdf2 function.

Remember our CPU runs all the instructions inside of a thread one by one. So far thread had some line of instructions inside of it that said run this code that takes one second to run then that's pretty much it. We have to wait one second for that code to run.

By using this thread pool right the above, we don't have to wait that one second and we can do other things inside of our event loop while that calculation is occuring.

# Threadpools with Multithreading

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");

const start = Date.now();

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("1:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("2:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("3:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("4:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("5:", Date.now() - start);
});

// results
1: 920
2: 1003
4: 1070
3: 1093
// 처음 4개의 결과가 출력되고 잠시 pause되고 마지막께 출력되는 것을 확인할 수 있다.
5: 1570

```

![image-20200223034658826](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\21.Node)

Notice that the first group up here all took the exact same amount of time and it took roughly double what it had taken previously. So previously it took one second to get through the two calls but now it appears to be taking two seconds. 

The second thing I want you to note is that the fifth call over here only took one additional second. Let's try to figure why we saw the change in timing with the first group that ran. And then only one second to complete the fifth call.

![image-20200223034921435](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\22.Node)

Let's first consider the original program that we wrote where we had just two called pbkdf2. So in that case the first call was taken and we can kind of imagine that may it got assigned to the first thread and the thread pool.

That thread we can again we imagine that maybe this thread right here got assigned to running core number 1.

![image-20200223035135430](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\23.Node)

![image-20200223035152266](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\24.Node)

both took more or less exactly one second for each core to finish the hashing function call.

Let's now take the similar diagram but applied to the case that we just ran this in with the five function calls.

![image-20200223035252011](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\25.Node)

We can kind of get some level of concurrency with threads because our CPU has access to multi-threading or hyper threading which allows it to kind of process more than one thread at once.

So the first four calles to pbkdf2 to each get assigned to their own individual thread then thread number one and thread number two get assigned to Core #1, and thread number three and four get assigned to Core #2

![image-20200223035621424](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\26.Node)

Two cores are only able to process there two threads at the same time. Thanks to multi-threading technology in CPU. Because I've got multi-threading enbaled, I can process more than one thread at the same time. However each core **still had to do twice the amount of work** it just had to do twice amount of work at the same time, which is why we saw that it took roughly twice as long to calculate the hashing value for these first for values. **Because at the end of the day even though I have multi-threading enabled all that enables my CPU to do is process more threads at once. It doesn't actually speed up the processing it just allows for some amount of concurrency inside of the work that I'm doing.**

1. We saw those first four calls get processed. They took roughly double the amount of time and then once that was all complete and those first four tasks were done.
2. Node was able to finally move onto the fifth function call. Maybe that one got assigned to thread number four and thread number four maybe got assigned a core number two.

# Changeing Threadpool Size

Remember these threads can technically run at the same time but they still have to do just as much work as they did previously and that's why we saw it took twice as long for all the hashed to complete because it always takes one second to calculate one hash.

If we have four hashes but each core is taking twice as long to do that work it's going to take two seconds total. Let's move on a little bit and figure out how we can work with and customize the thread pool.

```javascript
// 동시에 라는 말이 정말 중요하다 여기서, 마치 프린터를 하나찍고 하나찍는게 아니라 두 장의 프린터를 왔다갔다 하면서 한 번에 찍는 것을 말한다 결론적으로 하나당 1초 씩 걸리니 2초가 걸리는 것을 동일하지만 포인트는 한 번에 2장을 모두 작업할 수 있다는 점이다..
4 threads for 2 cores, you will have for each core 2 threads.



Basically each core will try to execute each of its 2 threads simultaneously (basically, they will switch between the threads, which will give the impression that everything is done at the same time).



For this code, for example, every time you start node thread.js, the order of console.log may be different:

 
const crypto = require('crypto');
 
const start = Date.now();
crypto.pbkdf2('a', 'b', 100000, 512, 'sha512', () => {
    console.log('1:', Date.now() - start);
});
 
crypto.pbkdf2('a', 'b', 100000, 512, 'sha512', () => {
    console.log('2:', Date.now() - start);
});
 
crypto.pbkdf2('a', 'b', 100000, 512, 'sha512', () => {
    console.log('3:', Date.now() - start);
});
 
crypto.pbkdf2('a', 'b', 100000, 512, 'sha512', () => {
    console.log('4:', Date.now() - start);
});
```

##### Thread-Pool

```javascript
process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 2;
const crypto = require("crypto");

const start = Date.now();

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("1:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("2:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("3:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("4:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("5:", Date.now() - start);
});

// results
2: 1108
1: 1117
3: 2321
4: 2364
5: 3447
```

![image-20200223041310241](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\27.Node)

The first call gets assigned to Thread 1. The second call gets assigned to the right number to thread number. One probably gets allocated to number one thread. Number two probably gets allocated to core number two.

![image-20200223041439420](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\28.Node)

Each core only has to do one has at a time. So we're back to the hasing only taking one second after the first two hases are complete. The next two calls are loaded into thread number one and thread number two. Again that takes one second and then finally after that is done the fifth call can be loaded in as well.

So that gives you a better idead of how we can customize a thread pool and see what happens when we decrease the number of threads that are available.

```javascript
process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 5;
const crypto = require("crypto");

const start = Date.now();

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("1:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("2:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("3:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("4:", Date.now() - start);
});

crypto.pbkdf2("a", "b", 100000, 512, "sha512", () => {
  console.log("5:", Date.now() - start);
});

// results
2: 2955
1: 2976
3: 2987
4: 2996
5: 3004
```

It looks like it took quite a while but when it eventually resolved it took a total of about three seconds and everything completed at the exact same time.

![image-20200223041813205](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\29.Node)

We've got Thread 1 to 5. We have an equal number of threads to the number of hashing function calls. So each hashing function call instantly gets their own thread assinged. And now this time 

![image-20200223041923625](C:\Users\user\Desktop\study\Study_Repo\Nodejs_Advanced_Concepts\images\30.Node)

In reality, our CPU can use all the cores inside of it to juggle work between multiple threads. So when I say that thread number one gets assinged to core number one. That's not entirely accurate. 

This arrests schedule right here kind of decides how to juggle all the work in total behind all the cores that are avaialble. So in the end of the day all five threads get roughly equal amounts of CPU time at the same time.

But this time it took about longer than 2.5 seconds because just as before we have only two cores available. By default it takes one core one second to process one hash. So when we have five hashes at the same time it's going to take two cores five divided by two, 2.5 seconds

자 그렇다면 이제 Node.js의 어떤 function이 위와 같은 threadpool의 개념을 적용할 수 있는지 알아보자.
